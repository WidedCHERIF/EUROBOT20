In the MDK-ARM you will find all the libraries used in the main Program:
1/Motor Module: In this module, we have fuctions to set the PWN of the Motors and their direction.
2/Robot_Navig_Euro20 Module: In this module , we have fuctions that helps us locate our robot and correct its orientation after every mouvement.
3/ Odemetry Module: Since we are using encoders to calculate the distance that our robot has moved, we have set in this module fuctions to read from this encoder.
